                    <p>We think that our words, deeds, and behaviors all contribute to the development of trust. Fostering integrity allows us to bring out the best in one other, especially when we can build bridges between diverse points of view and values. Through the power of confession, we are devoted to building new avenues of empathy, care, and respect for others by being compassionate with one another. Constructive criticism is encouraged as long as it is delivered in a courteous manner. We are a platform that offers diversity, supports expression, and fosters a safe and welcoming environment, therefore you may confess and be at piece in disclosing your secret, not your identity.</p>

The term implies that you are disclosing something that you feel others in your life are unaware of, and it could be interpreted as an admission of a moral or legal transgression.
                    You must submit a confession for an action you took. The submission will be withdrawn if it does not include a confession or violate our terms. </p>
